# Algorithm

This branch consists of multiple solutions and tricks for algorithm questions. Hope it would give you much fun!!



It is mainly related to python and java implementation and the questions are mainly from leetcode and lintcode. 



The java version has all  implementations of solutions using java. All other directories are implementations of solutions using python. 



I would update and refactor it from now and then. You could use any code in whatever way you want ! Just want to share the joy and fun!
